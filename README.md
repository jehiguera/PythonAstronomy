# PythonAstronomy

PythonAstronomy is a project intended to learn the use of the Python libraries Astropy and Poliastro.
Both libraries contain key functionality and common tools needed for performing astronomy and astrophysics with Python. 
Astropy library aims to enable the community to develop a robust ecosystem of affiliated packages covering a broad range of needs for astronomical 
research, data processing, and data analysis.

These examples run in any drive in the cloud  using https://colab.research.google.com/
